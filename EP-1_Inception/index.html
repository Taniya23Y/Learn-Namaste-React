<!--    Summary   -->
<!--
    The HTML document structure includes the usual elements: <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <meta>, <title>, and <body>.
    The title of the document is set to "Namaste REact".
    Inside the <body> tag, there's a <div> element with an id of "root".
    Initially, there's an HTML comment inside the <div>, which is commented out.
    The JavaScript script creates a new <h1> element, sets its inner HTML content to "Hello World from JavaScript!", and then appends this <h1> element to the <div> element with the id of "root".
    So, when the page is loaded, it will display "Hello World from JavaScript!" as the heading within the <div> with the id of "root".
